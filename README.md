Hangman
 
This project was preceded by two weeks of learning the C language on Opikoodia course's C language segment,
and it aims to showcase the things I have picked up during that time. I felt that the difficulty of the project
hit a sweet spot, where I had the tools to be able to solve the problems presented, while still being
difficult enough to require some elbow grease.

The game Hangman is essentially a word guessing game where the player is given the length of the word and
a number of guesses (in my program's case 6 wrong guesses) to try and guess letters that are in the word, and eventually
guess the whole word. While making this project I  learned a lot about using for loops and if statements
inside the loops to check for example the player input against the right word character array.
I was also able to incorporate Boolean variables into the program and they proved to be a huge help.
I got a taste of testing while trying to break the program with different input and the end product turned out quite stable.
